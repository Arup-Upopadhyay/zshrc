# zshrc
Working with plain bash is not fun, zshrc enables me to do more with little configuration, and it is super cool with loads of plugins which makes me even more productive and happy.

#Use powerline9k for theme and nerd-complete for fonts,
1. git clone https://github.com/bhilburn/powerlevel9k.git ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes/powerlevel9k
2. Download any font from nerd complete website and export them, to */.fonts amd run the command: fc-cache -fv
